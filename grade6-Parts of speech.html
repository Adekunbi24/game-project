                <p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
                <p>Before we dive in you should understand what parts of speech are in Grammar!</p>
                <p><b>The Parts Of Speech</b></p>
                <p>In a sentence, words can be considered as the smallest components that have unique meanings. We can categorize words into several types or parts of speech based on their use and functions.
                    <br>An individual word can function as more than one part of speech when used in different circumstances. Therefore, understanding parts of speech is essential for determining the correct meaning of a word.</p>
                <p>There are eight parts of speech in the English language: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.</p>
                <img src="image/Partsofspeech.png" class="img-fluid" width="80%" alt="Parts of speech">
                <p><b>1. The Noun</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to words that are used to name persons, places, things, events or ideas. All nouns are naming words.</p>
                <p><u>Example:</u> Ravi, woman, boy (person); elephant, rabbit, tiger (animal); parrot, crow, sparrow (bird); Delhi, Mumbai, India (place);
                    <br>computer, mobile, pencil (thing); honesty, courage (idea), etc. Whatever we can see, feel or think and have names are considered nouns.</p>
                <p><u>Sample Sentences:</u></p>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;">  1. Benji lives in Lagos.
                <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 2. Derrick uses an ink pen for jotting notes.


                <p><b>2. The Pronoun</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word that replaces a noun. They eliminate the need for repetition.
                    <br> A pronoun is usually substituted for a specific noun, which is called its antecedent.</p>
                <p><u>Example:</u> I, you, he, she, we, ours, mine, yours, his, her, him, hers, they, them, theirs, it, etc.</p>
                <p><u>Sample Sentences:</u></p>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 1. Jia is a very determined child. She always focuses on her goal.
                <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 2. The largest share is mine.


                <p><b>3. The Adjective</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word that modifies, describes or gives more information about a noun or pronoun.
                    <br> Adjectives are describing words and normally come before the nouns.</p>
                <p><u>Example:</u> fast, quiet, useful, much, pretty, old, blue, smart, beautiful, big, sad, red, young, fun, crazy, three etc.</p>
                <p><u>Sample Sentences:</u></p>

                <p><b>4. The Verb</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word that tells us what the subject does, or what happens to it,
                    <br> or what state it is in, or what possesses.</p>
                <p><u>Examples:</u> am, is, was, are, were, have, has, had, do, does, did, be, am, is, are, was, were, being,
                    <br>been, should, could, will, would, might, can, may, must, shall, ought (to), go, speak, run, eat, play, live, walk, like etc.</p>

                <p><b>5. The Adverb</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word that modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb.
                    <br>Adverbs tell us how, when, where, how often and to what degree (extent) something happens or takes place. Adverbs often end in -ly.</p>
                <p><u>Examples: gently, quickly, extremely, carefully, well, slowly, quietly, very, always, never, too, tomorrow, here etc.</u></p>
                <p><u>Sample sentences:</u></p>

                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word or a group of words that shows its relation with another noun or pronoun or a verb.
                    <br> Therefore it can also be called as a ‘relation’ word and comes before a noun or a pronoun in a sentence.
                    <br>They are used to indicate time, place, direction or relationship.</p>
                <p><u>Example:</u> in, on, into, at, by, upon, across, beside, between, of, out of, for, above, below, throughout, outside, before, near etc.</p>

                <p><b>7. The Conjunction (Connectors or Linking Words)</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word that joins two or more words, phrases, or clauses.
                    <br> There are three kinds of conjunctions:</p>
                <p><b>1.Coordinating Conjunctions:</b> These are the words that join words, phrases, and clauses of
                    <br>equal grammatical importance in the sentence. Example: and, but, or, so, nor, for, yet.</p>
                <p><b>2.Correlative Conjunctions:</b>These are the words that join equally important ideas, but they work in pairs.
                    <br>Example: either...or, both...and, not only...but also, neither…nor, whether…or, either…or</p>
                <p><b>3.Subordinating Conjunctions:</b> These are the words that join words, phrases, and clauses that are not equal.
                    <br> Example: because, although, while, since, after, as, as if, before, even if, even though, if,
                    <br> so that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, wherever, whether.</p>
                <p><u>Sample sentences:</u></p>

                <p><b>8. The Interjection</b></p>
                <p>This part of a speech refers to a word or phrase that states strong, sudden emotions. It expresses strong feelings of joy, sadness,
                    <br>surprise, appreciation, condemnation, etc. Since interjections are commonly used to convey strong emotions, they are usually
                    <br>followed by an exclamation mark but in case of mild interjections we place comma after the interjection.</p>
                <p>Example: Ouch!, Alas!, Oh!, Bravo!, Fantastic!, Gorgeous!, Wow!, Hurrah!, Pooh!, Pshaw!, Fie!, Gosh!</p>
                <p><u>Sample Sentences</u></p>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 1.  Ouch! I got hurt.
                    <p style="text-indent:30px;">2.  Hurray! Tomorrow is a holiday.


                <p><b>Note 1:</b> Articles and determiners like a, an, the, some, any, etc. are also adjectives but they are studied separately due
                    <br>to their importance in modifying the meaning of the word they qualify.</p>
                <p><b>Note 2: Same Word – Several Parts of Speech</b></p>
                <p>There are words that can be used in more than one way. This implies that a word can function as several different parts of speech.
                    <br>The function of a word in a sentence decides to which part of speech it belongs.</p>
                <p>Study the below sentences</p>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;"> 1.   She like to watch plays on T.V. (noun)
                    <p style="text-indent:30px;">2.   He plays cricket during his vacation. (verb)
