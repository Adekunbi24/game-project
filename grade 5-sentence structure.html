                <p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
                <p> This lesson will focus on teaching the fundamentals of creating good sentences that<br>
                    are applicable for every day communication</p>

                <p><b>What is a sentence?</b></p>

                <p>A Sentence:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>A new sentence begins with a capital letter</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>He obtained his degree.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A sentence ends with punctuation (a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point).</li>
                 <ul><li>She likes dancing.</li></ul>
                <li>A sentence contains a subject that is only given once</li>
                <ul><li><del>Smith</del> he obtained his degree.</li></ul>
                <li>A sentence contains a verb or a verb phrase</li>
                <ul><li>He <b>obtained</b> his degree.</li></ul>
                <li>A sentence follows Subject + Verb + Object word order</li>
                <ul><li><b>He</b> (subject) <b>obtained</b> (verb) <b>his degree</b> (object).</li></ul>
                <li>A sentence must have a complete idea that stands alone. This is also called an independent clause</li>
                <ul><li><b>He obtained his degree.</b></li></ul>
            </ul>

                <p><b>Definitions and Examples of basic English elements</b></p>
                <p>Key: Yellow, bold = subject; green underline = verb, blue, italics = object, pink, regular font = prepositional phrase</p>
                <p><b>Independent clause:</b> An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence. It contains a subject and a verb and is a complete idea.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I like spaghetti.</li>
                    <li>He reads many books.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Dependent clause:</b> A dependent clause is not a complete sentence.<br>
                    It must be attached to an independent clause to become complete. This is also known as a subordinate clause.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Although I like spaghetti,…</b></li>
                    <li><b>Because he reads many books,…</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Subject:</b> A person, animal, place, thing, or concept that does an action. Determine the subject in a sentence by asking the question “Who or what?”</p>
<ul>
                    <li><mark>I</mark> like spaghetti.</li>
                    <li><mark>Jeff </mark>reads many books.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Verb</b>: Expresses what the person, animal, place, thing, or concept does. Determine the verb in a sentence by asking the question “What was the action or what happened?”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I like spaghetti.</li>
                    <li>He reads many books.</li>
                    <li>The movie is good. (The be verb is also sometimes referred to as a copula or a linking verb. It links the subject, in this case "the movie," to the complement or the predicate of the sentence, in this case, "good.")</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Object</b>: A person, animal, place, thing, or concept that receives the action. Determine the object in a sentence by asking the question “The subject did what?” or “To whom?/For whom?”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I like spaghetti.</li>
                        <li>He reads many books.</li>
                        </ul>


                <p><b>Prepositional Phrase</b>: A phrase that begins with a preposition (i.e., in, at for, behind, until, after, of, during) and modifies a word in the sentence.
                    <br> A prepositional phrase answers one of many questions. Here are a few examples: “Where? When? In what way?”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I like spaghetti for dinner.</li>
                        <li>He reads many books in the library.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><b>Simple Sentence</b></p>
                <p>A simple sentence contains a subject and a verb, and it may also have an object and modifiers. However, it contains only one independent clause.</p>
                <p>Key: Yellow, bold = subject; green underline = verb, blue, italics = object, pink, regular font =prepositional phrase</p>
                <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She wrote.</li>
                    <li>she completed her literature review.</li>
                    <li>He organized his sources by theme</li>
                </ul>
  <p><b> Compound Sentence </b></p>
                <p>A compound sentence contains at least two independent clauses.  These two independent clauses can be combined with a comma and a coordinating conjunction or with a semicolon.</p>
                <p>Key: independent clause = yellow, bold; comma  or semicolon = pink, regular font; coordinating conjunction = green, underlined</p>
                <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She completed her literature review, and she created her reference list.</li>
                    <li>He organized his sources by theme; then, he updated his reference list..</li>
                    <li>They studied APA rules for many hours, but they realized there was still much to learn.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><b> Complex Sentence </b></p>


                <p>A complex sentence contains at least one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.<br>
                    Dependent clauses can refer to the subject (who, which) the sequence/time (since, while), <br>
                    or the causal elements (because, if) of the independent clause.</p>
                <p>If a sentence begins with a dependent clause, note the comma after this clause. <br>
                    If, on the other hand, the sentence begins with an independent clause, there is not a comma separating the two clauses.</p>
                <p>Key: independent clause = yellow, bold; comma = pink, regular font; dependent clause = blue, italics</p>
                <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Although she completed her literature review, she still needed to work on her methods section.</li>
                    <ul><li>Note the comma in this sentence because it begins with a dependent clause.</li></ul>
                    <li>Because he organized his sources by theme, it was easier for his readers to follow.</li>
                    <ul><li>Note the comma in this sentence because it begins with a dependent clause.</li></ul>
                    <li>They studied APA rules for many hours as they were so interesting.</li>
                    <ul><li>Note that there is no comma in this sentence because it begins with an independent clause.</li></ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Using some compound sentences in writing allows for more sentence variety.</p>

                  <p><b>Compound Complex Sentence </b></p>

                <p>Sentence types can also be combined. A compound-complex sentence contains at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.</p>
                <p>Key: independent clause = yellow, bold; comma  or semicolon = pink, regular font; coordinating conjunction = green, underlined; dependent clause = blue, italics</p>
                <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She completed her literature review, but she still needs to work on her methods section even though she finished her methods course last semester.</li>

                    <li>Although he organized his sources by theme, he decided to arrange them chronologically, and he carefully followed the MEAL plan for organization.</li>

                    <li>With pizza and soda at hand, they studied APA rules for many hours, and they decided that writing in APA made sense because it was clear, concise, and objective.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using some compound sentences in writing allows for more sentence variety.</p>
                <p>Pay close attention to comma usage in complex-compound sentences so that the reader is easily able to follow the intended meaning.</p>
