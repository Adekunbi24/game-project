                <p><b> Topic: Building a Class Project</b></p>

                <p> Grayson sat alone on the bus ride
home from school. He didn’t want to talk
to his friends or anybody else. They were
all discussing their class projects for the
weekend. They were excited, and they
didn’t understand why Grayson wasn’t
excited. He wasn’t going to explain it,
either.
</p>
                <p>Grayson’s cheeks grew warm with embarrassment when he thought about his
lack of excitement. How could they understand his feelings when their parents would
help them? Grayson didn’t have anyone to help. His mom worked all the time, and
his dad never wanted to do anything with him.</p>
                 <p> When the bus stopped at his street, he hopped out and raced home before
anyone could stop him. He burst through the door of his apartment, dropped his
backpack on the !oor, and stomped to his room.</p>
                <p>“Grayson?” Grandpa’s voice called out. “Was that you?”</p>

                <p>Grayson stopped before he closed his bedroom door. He didn’t want to hurt
Grandpa’s feelings so he had better answer. “Yes, Grandpa, it’s me.”
</p>
                <p>Grandpa Higgins came from the kitchen carrying a sandwich. “How was school
today?” he asked as he took a bite.
</p>
                <p>Grayson shrugged. “It was okay, I guess.”</p>
                <p>“You don’t sound too convincing.”</p>
                <p>Should Grayson tell Grandpa the truth? What could it hurt? He quickly explained
how they had been assigned a class project for the weekend. Each student needed to
ask a grown up for help, and together they would build something. The students
needed to make a report to explain how their projects had gone.</p>
                <p>Grandpa listened quietly. “That sounds nice,” he said when Grayson !nished.
“Why does it have you so discouraged?”</p>
                <p>Grayson felt his sadness and anger rising inside him. “Because I don’t have
anyone to help me.” He sounded so pathetic.</p>
                <p>Grandpa raised his eyebrows in surprise. “What am I?” he asked. “Chopped liver?”</p>
                <p>Grayson froze in surprise. Would Grandpa help him? “You’d build a project with
me, Grandpa?”</p>
                <p>“Sure, I would,” Grandpa said. He turned back toward the kitchen. “Just let me
!nish this sandwich and get some milk.”</p>
                <p>Grayson’s heart seemed so light he thought it would "oat away. Maybe this
project wasn’t so bad, after all.</p>
                <p>He raced to his backpack and unzipped it, then he retrieved his assignment
paper. When Grandpa finished eating, they sat at the table and made a list of ideas.
They settled on building a cardboard robot from old cereal and pasta boxes from the kitchen. They used glue, staples, and tape. Grandpa even found a box of eyeball
stickers.</p>
                <p>When they finished, the kitchen table was a mess. Debris littered the entire
surface, but Grayson couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
                <p>“What do you think?” Grandpa asked.</p>
                <p>Grayson looked at their misshapen robot. “I think it’s the best robot I ever built.
Now I have to write my report.”</p>
                <p>He grabbed the robot and turned toward his room, but he paused. He ran to
Grandpa’s side and hugged him. “Thank you for helping me, Grandpa. I had a lot of fun.”</p>
                <p>Grandpa squeezed his shoulders. “Me, too. Now, go write your report. Maybe next
time we can build something that explodes, like a volcano.”</p>
                <p>Grayson smiled again. He could hardly wait.</p>
